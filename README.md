I made this project under Prof. Sharmila Banu K, while doing the online course "Natural Language Processing" by National Research University. This course was broadly categorized into five weeks, with each week focusing on separate topics like Text to Vectors, Sequence Modeling, Intent Classification, etc. As the final project, I build a dialog system and hosted it to AWS. Here is the link to the course:
